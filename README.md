## Preface

  

This project was developed for the Aseer Tabtaker (عسير تبتكر) Hackathon 2025, organized by the Aseer Development Authority (ASDA). The hackathon challenges participants to create innovative technological solutions that address development challenges in the Aseer region, with a focus on smart tourism, environmental sustainability, investment facilitation, transportation infrastructure, and design innovation.

Our project, Masra, was specifically designed for the Smart Tourism track, aiming to leverage technology to enhance the mountain tourism experience in Saudi Arabia's Aseer region while promoting the area's natural beauty and cultural significance on both local and international platforms.

## Project Overview

Masra is a mobile application that enhances the mountain tourism experience in Saudi Arabia's Asir region. Our platform connects tourists with certified local guides, provides AI-powered safety assessments, and gamifies the exploration experience through a physical and digital passport system.

## Problem Statement

Asir region possesses world-class mountain trails for mountain activities, but faces several challenges:

1. Limited International Recognition: Despite having exceptional natural beauty and trails, Aseer is simply not discussed enough in local and international forums.
2. Safety Information Gap: Tourists lack access to real-time safety data and trail conditions.
3. Guide Connection Issues: No platform to connect tourists with certified local guides, raising the barrier of entry to first-time hikers in the kingdom
4. Experience Tracking: No system to encourage repeat visits and exploration

## Solution

  

Masra aims to address these key problems through:

  

### Shining A Spotlight On The Gem That Is Aseer

  

By leveraging techniques that promote virality, we aim to put a spotlight on Aseer's natural beauty and it's cultural and historical significance. Our Main Techniques are as follows:

  

#### Qimam Passport

  

Inspired by the Dubai Expo 2020 Event and the impact that it had made on Expo goers, this physical and digital passport aims to act as a trophy to show off and a souvenir for hikers.

  

#### Seasonal Challenges & Content

  

As is standard with apps of this nature, competitions and rewards create an environment where people are inclined to share their achievement. We also want to emphasize Aseer as a year-round destination for hikers and so we wanted to do seasonal challenges!

  

#### Smart Photos

  

Virality cannot be channeled via the app and word of mouth alone, we also aim to gain a strong social media presence and the ability to create filters that celebrate Asir's cultural and natural beauty, such as a Flower man Headdress filter and and stickers that utilize Al-Qatt Al-Asiri.

  

### Local Guide Network

  

It took us around an hour to find the directory of certified guides in Saudi Arabia, and even then, we were not satisfied with how rudimentary it was. All it had was a phone number and where they were based out of. We did not know the guide's availability, schedule, language proficiency, their personality. We aim to change that and to empower guides by allowing them to express themselves and truly woo their clientelle.

  

• Certified local guide directory with booking capabilities

• Ratings and review system for quality assurance

• Direct booking and payment integration

• Cultural and adventure tour specializations

## Tech Stack

### Prototype

Our initial prototype was done on Figma and was a team effort. Every team member spent countless hours reviewing the best UI and UX design choices and communicating with different organizations in the kingdom to discuss the feasibility and viability of our project. Information disclosure was kept to a minimum.

If we are to reach the final stage, we will start developing the MVP and transitioning our interfaces to useable widgets in Dart. In the meantime, we have been reading up on Mapbox's SDK documentation and are discussing system architecture to help facilitate our integration.

## ASDA Goal Alignment

  

This project directly supports the Aseer Development Authority's vision for Aseer, which can be found below:

  

"To transform Aseer into a global tourist destination through infrastructure projects that make it the epitome of modernity, with authenticity and natural beauty at its core.

  

The Aseer region will become a world-class tourist destination in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and abroad by striking a balance between development and conservation. By offering a wide range of entertainment, cultural and sporting opportunities, this region has the potential to become a cohesive and inclusive society without encroaching upon its natural environment." ___[reference](____https://www.asda.gov.sa/en/vision/)___

  

This is done by keeping it at the forefront of mountain sport technology for tourists hoping to engage in mountain sports.
